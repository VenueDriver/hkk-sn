# Your secret key is used for verifying the integrity of signed cookies.
# If you change this key, all old signed cookies will become invalid!

# Make sure the secret is at least 30 characters and all random,
# no regular words or you'll be exposed to dictionary attacks.
# You can use `rake secret` to generate a secure secret key.

# Make sure the secrets in this file are kept private
# if you're sharing your code publicly.

# The standard advice:
# # Do not keep production secrets in the repository,
# # instead read values from the environment.
# Because we use the Engine Yard platform, the only way for us to set an environment variable
# is to do it with a Chef recipe.  That means that the secret would still be in a repository,
# it would just be in a different repository.  To keep it off of GitHub entirely, we use the
# production database for sensitive information like this.
